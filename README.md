This project predicts house prices in Boston using a machine learning model trained on housing features like crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax rate etc...

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (XGBoost)
- Streamlit for deployment

## 📂 Files
- `app.py` – Web app script
- `model.pkl` – Trained model
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
- `.ipynb` – Model training code

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User inputs housing data
2. Model predicts price instantly
3. Result on Streamlit UI
